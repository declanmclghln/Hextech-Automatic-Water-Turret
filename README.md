# Challenges (possible)
- Running out of water if using source with minimal water


# Lessons Learned
Before I built this robot I had only worked with Hetxtech once with another robot. Throughout the creation of the water turret I learnt how gears can be utilized, how parts or pieaces that have a main purpose can be used for other tasks, and how to efficiently code with multiple motors. Due to Hextech, I am able to have an easy and successful hands on experience with inventing, building, designing, coding, and much more..
