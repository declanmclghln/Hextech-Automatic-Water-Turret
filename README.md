# Hextech-Automatic-Water-Turret
Powered by the Hextech muscle board, the automatic water turret is used to water plants efficiently spreading water throughout the area without the need of physical labor. 

# Demo Video
A video of the robot operating can be found and downloaded in [Demo (5).mp4](DEMO%20(5).mp4)

# Assembly 
- 3d print all provided design files and order all excess materials. 3d Printed Designs are fround in [3d Water Turret](3d%20Water%20Turret). Listed materials on a sheet are found in [Water Turret Materials](Water%20Turret%20.xlsx)
- Join all the parts with screws ranging from M3-M5 [Top to bottom: base, lazy susan, disk gear, turret body, tilt bracket]
- Put the hose through the body and hold it in place with screws at the tilting bracket


# Code Overview
The code was completed in VSCode using python from the Hextech Library. The completed code used is found in [Water Turret Code](Water%20Turret%20Code/water_turret.py)



# Challenges (possible)
- Running out of water if using source with minimal water
  


# Lessons Learned
Before I built this robot I had only worked with Hetxtech once with another robot. Throughout the creation of the water turret I learnt how gears can be utilized, how parts or pieaces that have a main purpose can be used for other tasks, and how to efficiently code with multiple motors. Due to Hextech, I am able to have an easy and successful hands on experience with inventing, building, designing, coding, and much more..
